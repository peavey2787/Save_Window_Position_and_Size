![save_win_size_and_pos-screenshot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b968300-02cf-40a7-84cf-42cd2988d530)

A Windows utility that saves and restores window positions and sizes for your applications.

## Overview

This application allows you to:
- Save window positions and sizes for any application
- Automatically restore windows to their saved positions
- Manage multiple window layout profiles
- Keep important windows always on top
- Visually highlight windows for easy identification
- Create quick layouts that can be restored with a single click

## Main Features

### Profiles
The application supports multiple profiles, allowing you to save different window layouts for different scenarios. Select a profile from the dropdown menu in the top-right corner.

### System Tray Icon
The application minimizes to the system tray. Double-click the tray icon to show/hide the main window. Right-click for additional options:
- Show GUI - Opens the main interface
- Start/Stop Auto Moving - Enables/disables automatic window positioning
- Capture Current Layout - Saves all current window positions to the active profile or another profile
- Create Quick Layout - Creates a minimized form in the taskbar that can restore the current layout or a specific profile's layout with a single click
- Switch Profile - Quickly change between saved profiles
- Exit - Closes the application

### Running Apps List
Shows all currently running applications. Select an app to view or edit its position and size settings.

### Saved Apps List
Shows all applications saved in the current profile. Select a saved app to view or edit its settings.

### Quick Layouts
Quick layouts allow you to save the current window layout to a minimized form in the taskbar. Clicking this form will restore all windows to their saved positions and sizes with a single click, making it easy to switch between different window arrangements.

**Important**: Quick layouts operate as independent applications. Once created, they continue to function even if you close the main Save Window Position and Size application. This makes them perfect for quickly restoring common window arrangements without needing the main app running.

## Context Menus

### Quick Layout Button Menu
Click the Quick Layout button to access its context menu:
- **Create from Current Layout** - Creates a quick layout based on the current window arrangement
- **Create from Profile** - Creates a quick layout based on windows in a specific profile without switching to that profile

### Capture Layout Button Menu
Click the Capture Layout button to access its context menu:
- **Current Profile** - Replaces all windows in the current profile with the current window layout
- **[Profile Names]** - Captures the current window layout to a specific profile without switching to it

These context menus allow for powerful, flexible management of window layouts without disrupting your current workspace.

### Quick Capture All Windows

Add applications to the ignore list if:
- They appear in the running apps list but don't have visible windows
- You don't want them to be affected by the automatic positioning feature

You can add apps to the ignore list by right-clicking an app in the Running Apps list and selecting "Ignore".

### Window Highlighting
When you select a window from either list, the application will briefly highlight it with a red border to help you identify it on screen.
